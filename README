Hi, Using this repo to store some dot files and basic system setup.
I doubt it will be useful to anyone but feel free to take a look.

This is for my Fedora Laptop (version 20)

System configuration locations
~/.bashrc
~/.xmodmap
~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml

#Key Mappings (Swapping ESC and Caps Lock)
xmodmap -pke #to view key mappings
xev | grep key # to view keynumbers
~.xmodmap #create and add the following to add escape to the Caps_Lock key
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add lock = Caps_Lock

#Enable CTRL-ALT-L Locking  (Just adding a key lock command I am used to)
~/.config/openbox/lxde-rc.xml
#between <keyboard> and </keyboard>
<keybind key="C-A-L">      
  <action name="Execute">        
   <command>xscreensaver-command -lock</command>      
  </action>    
</keybind>

#Autostart utils
~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
#contains
@konsole
@firefox
@xflux -l 53.3 -g 6.3 #this is a nice program to adjust screen birghtness, easy on the eyes
