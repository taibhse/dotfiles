Hi, Using this repo to store some dot files and basic system setup.
Warning: I have a git pull as part of my bash config to keep everything updated.

What Do?(setup)
1. Clone this repo to your machine. (git clone into your home directory)
2. Add your dotfiles into the root of this repo. (in the newly created dotfiles folder)
3. Edit makesymlinks.sh and add the names of your dotfiles to the `file` var
4. Run the script

If anything goes wrong PANIC!, then give me a shout and I will help you out.
